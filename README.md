## Crusaders-and-their-Journeys

When the events of any battle are covered, the focus is usually on the immediate battle, its tactics, and the strategies used during the battle; they tell about the number of troops, their types, and the place of the battle... However, few people focus on the story of the preparation for the battle itself, it is almost never paid attention to, and if it is paid attention to, it is very concise and short, everyone wants to see the climax , which is a battle, not a preparation for it.

I want to offer you to look at it from a slightly different, unusual side, not at the battles themselves, no, there is plenty of that anyway, but at the preparation for the battles itself, at the process, not the climax.

Let's look at the Crusades. Why the Crusades? In particular, they belonged to the XIII century. Why XIII century? Finger to the sky :)

So, any campaign starts from some point A and aims to reach some point B, where the battle will actually take place. So let's consider the process of the campaign itself, from its beginning to its culmination - the battle.

Suppose you are ready to go. You have gathered the army and provisions, and now the bell is ringing, indicating the beginning of the campaign. At this moment, the most diverse emotions and moods are raging, where in a few moments the first step will be taken, which will open a new chapter in history...

So if you're willing to take this trek to its climax, with no hope, no witnesses, no reward, we're happy to give you that opportunity. We will wait for you on the other side of the barricades.

Ah yes, I almost forgot - good luck! And most importantly, have fun, otherwise it doesn't make any sense :D
